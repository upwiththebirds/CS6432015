What is GitHub? 

GitHub is a Web-based Git repository hosting service. It offers version control and source code management. It also has itâ€™s own features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management etc. 

When was it created? Why? By who? 

Development of the GitHub platform began on October 1, 2007. It was created to help the developers to work together for the same project and manage their source code. The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston- Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett after it had been made available for a few months prior as a beta period.


What similar platforms exist? 

Bitbucket, Readmine, Launchpad etc

Why would you use such a platform?

The platform would help me manage my project and source code, also it will bring my project for the community to access.
